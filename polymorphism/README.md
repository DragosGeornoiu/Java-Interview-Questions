### What is Polymorphism?

Polymorphism is a concept by which we can perform a single task in different ways. That is, when a single entity 
(object) behaves differently in different cases, it is called polymorphism.
In other words, if a single object shows multiple forms or multiple behaviors, it is called polymorphism.

### What is the difference between Runtime polymorphism and Compile time polymorphism?
Compile-Time polymorphism (also called static binding or Early binding) refers to method overloading, and it is
in same class.
Runtime polymorphism (also called Dynamic binding or Late binding) refers to method overriding, and it is in 
different classes.

### What are the advantages of Runtime polymorphism?

The main advantage is the ability of a subclass to provide a different behavior then the behavior of the superclass.
Meaning a subclass can provide a different implementation of a method (overwriting the method from the superclass) and
the method from the subclass is used when we have an object with the type of the superclass, but the instance is 
of the subclass.

### What are the advantages of Compile time polymorphism?
Compile time polymorphism can be achieved by implementing Method overloading where a class contains multiple methods 
with the same names but given methods perform different activities, and they can be distinguished from one another by 
changing their 'number of arguments' or 'data type ' or 'order of data type in arguments'.
